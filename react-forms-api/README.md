# React Form API

This is the backend for the [Form](https://laurielim-react-forms.netlify.app/) I created in my React.js classes as part of the Full Stack Web Development Program at [Business College Helsinki](https://en.bc.fi/qualifications/full-stack-web-developer-program/). [Link to the api here](https://murmuring-peak-15912.herokuapp.com/).

Note that I am hosting it on Heroku with a free plan and that the data is stored in a json file. Heroku has an ephemeral filesystem. This means that anything posted is lost when the container which runs my app refreshes/restarts, which happens quite often. However as this is a demo/part of a class exercise, I choose to leave it as such.
